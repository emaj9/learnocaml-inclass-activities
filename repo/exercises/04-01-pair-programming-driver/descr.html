    <h2> Pair programming higher-order functions </h2>

    <p>
        Pair programming is a software development technique in which one
        programmer, the <em>driver</em>, uses the keyboard to write the code
        while another, the <em>navigator</em>, guides the development and
        performs live code review. A crucial component of this development style
        is that it's <em>two</em> developers to <em>one</em> computer.

    <h3> You are the driver </h3>

    <p>
        If you opened this exercise, it's because you are the <em>driver</em>.
        The responsibilities of the driver are the following.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> Talk through the code as you write it; don't leave the navigator in the dark! </li>
        <li> Ask questions to the navigator, especially when you're unsure of what to write next. </li>
        <li> Last but not least, you write the code! </li>
    </ul>
