        This is the second exercise in a series that will guide you in writing
        a playable implementation of a game similar to UNO.

        This exercise builds directly on the first part. Make sure you complete part 1 first!

        In this exercise, you will explore the second step of TDD: modelling the
        interactions of the system's components.
        These interactions will take the form of functions. We will pay close
        attention to the notion of <em>invariant</em>, understand what
        invariants are present in the UNO system, and how our functions uphold
        these invariants.
    </p>

    <h2> Interactions between cards </h2>

    <h3> Follow-up cards </h3>

    <p>
        When it's your turn in UNO, here's what usually happens. First try to
        find a <em>suitable</em> card from your hand and play it. If you have no
        suitable cards, then you pick one up from the draw pile. If that card is
        <em>suitable</em>, then you can play it. Otherwise, you simply hold on
        to it and play moves to the next player.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've emphasized the word "suitable" on purpose. This suitability is in
        fact a relation between cards! In particular, you can add a card to the
        discard pile if it meets any of the following conditions.
        <ul>
            <li>
                The value of the top card of the discard pile equals the value
                of the card you want to play; e.g. a <code>3</code> of any color can
                be played on top of a <code>3</code> of any color.
            </li>
            <li>
                The color of the top card of the discard pile equals the color
                of the card you want to play; e.g. any green card can follow any
                other green card.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's call this relation between cards the <code>can_follow</code>
        relation. What we need to implement is a function that <em>decides</em>
        this relation. That is, implement the function <code>can_follow : card
        -> card -> bool</code> that outputs <code>true</code> if and only if the
        second card can be played on top of the first card.
    </p>

    <h3> Finding all follow-ups </h3>

    <p>
        Let's imagine how one would play our game for a moment.
        When it's a player's turn, they will choose a card from their hand to
        play or choose to pick up a card from the draw pile.
    </p>
    <p>
        One way to achieve this is to prompt the player with a list of choices,
        one for each card from their hand that they could play, and a final
        choice along the lines of "pick up a card".
        To create this list of choices,
