(* Q1.
 * Implement `can_follow` such that
 *   can_follow c1 c2 = true
 * only when c2 (understood to be coming from a player's hand)
 * can be played on top of c1 (the top card of the discard pile).

let can_follow (color1, value1) (color2, value2) = 
   _ || _ 

let rec find_follow_ups hand card = 
   raise NotImplemented

let rec remove_card card hand = 
   raise NotImplemented

let rec add_card card pile = 
   raise NotImplemented
