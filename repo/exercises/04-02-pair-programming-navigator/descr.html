    <h2> Pair programming higher-order functions </h2>

    <p>
        Pair programming is a software development technique in which one
        programmer, the <em>driver</em>, uses the keyboard to write the code
        while another, the <em>navigator</em>, guides the development and
        performs live code review. A crucial component of this development style
        is that it's <em>two</em> developers to <em>one</em> computer.
    </p>

    <h3> You are the navigator! </h3>

    <p>
        If you opened this exercise, it's because you are the <em>navigator</em>.
        The responsibilities of the navigator are the following.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Discuss with the driver the high-level structure of the code that
            will be written <em>before</em> any writing takes place.
            <ul>
                <li> Will you use pattern matching? On which parameter? </li>
                <li> What is the base case of the recursion? </li>
                <li> When will recursion, if any, take place? </li>
                <li> Discuss the expected output of the algorithm for a sample input. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            As the driver codes, be mindful of their decisions and don't
            hesitate to ask them about their choices.
            <ul>
                <li> Are the names of variables appropriate? </li>
                <li> Are appropriate type annotations added? </li>
                <li> What are the types of the variables introduced via pattern matching? </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Identify potential refactorings and discuss them either while the
            driver is coding, or jot them down and discuss them once the draft
            implementation is finished.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The same expression appears multiple times; should we
                    introduce a <code>let</code>-expression and eliminate the
                    redundancy?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is the function tail-recursive?
                    Does it matter that it is or isn't?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Be careful not to tell the driver <em>what</em> to write! Instead, let
        them decide what to write, but ensure that what is written is
        well-justified. You are guiding the driver, not bossing them around.
    </p>

    <h3> Part 1: finding all diamonds in a hand </h3>

    <p>
        The driver will implement a function that takes as input a
        <code>hand</code> and outputs a <code>hand</code> consisting only of the
        cards with the <code>Diamonds</code> suit from the input hand.
    </p>

    <p>
        The driver will decide a name for the function and for the function's input.
        For auto-grading purposes, the name of the function will have to be changed
        to <code>find_all_diamonds</code>. When the implementation is finished,
        explain this to the driver and change the name of the function to
        <code>find_all_diamonds</code>.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Encourage the driver to test their implementation on the given
            <code>sample_hand</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If they didn't already, ask the driver to add type annotations to
            the function header they write.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Part 2: going higher-order </h3>

    <p>
        In this part, the driver will generalize the function they wrote into a
        higher-order function that selects all cards from a given hand
        satisfying a given <em>predicate</em>.
        Read the following paragraphs separately and reconvene when you're both
        finished.
    </p>

    <p>
        A predicate is a function that inputs one thing and returns a boolean.
        It decides whether its input satisfies a certain property.
        For example, the function <code>fun n -> n mod 2 = 0</code> is a
        predicate on integers: it decides whether the input integer has the
        property of being an even number.
    </p>

    <p>
        The big idea of the generalization to do in this part of the exercise is
        this: the newly written function will accept not only a hand, but also a
        <em>predicate</em> on cards. The output of this new function will
        consist of all the cards from the input hand satisfying the property
        decided by the predicate.
    </p>

    <h4> Reconvene and share your understanding of predicates with each other </h4>

    <p>
        <b>Q2.1. Discuss with your partner:</b>
        in plain English, what is the predicate used in the implementation
        from part 1?

        <details>
            <summary>Hint</summary>
            Identify the expression that computes a boolean and
            describe what it checks.
        </details>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Q2.2.</b> Next, <b>ask the driver</b> to define this predicate in OCaml.
        If they're not sure how to start, the structure of the definition should
        look like <br>
        <code>let ??? = fun card -> ???</code> or <br>
        <code>let ??? card = ???</code> <br>
        Choose the name of the function according to the plain-English
        description you came up with.
        For autograding reasons, you will need to use a specific name, but since
        naming things is hardest thing in computer science, it's worth
        practising! After you decide on a name, click below to reveal the name
        you will need to use for the grader.
        <details>
            <summary>Click to reveal name</summary>
            <code>is_diamond</code>
            <p>
                Generally speaking, predicates are named like questions:
                <code>is_yadayada</code>, <code>has_whatever</code>,
                <code>can_yoodle</code>, etc.
            </p>
        </details>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Q2.3. As a team,</b> figure out what the type of the predicate is.
        <details>
            <summary>Hint</summary>
            Since it's a function of one input, the type will be of the form<br>
            <code>??? -> ???</code>
        </details>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Q2.4.</b> Now the driver is ready to start the implementation of the
        generalized function! <b>Ask the driver</b> to choose a name for the new
        function, and to choose names for its inputs.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q2.5. As a team,</b> work out the <em>type</em> of the function
        before the driver begins the implementation.

        <details>
            <summary>Hint 1</summary>
            Since this is a function of two inputs, the type will be of the form<br>
            <code>??? -> ??? -> ???</code>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Hint 2</summary>
            One of the parameters will be a predicate on cards, and you already
            worked out what is the type of a predicate on cards in Q2.3.
            Be sure to use parentheses, as <code>(?? -> ??) -> ??</code> is not
            the same as <code>?? -> ?? -> ??</code>!
        </details>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q2.6. Ask the driver</b> to implement the body of the function.

        Consider referring back to the guiding questions at the top of this document to
        prompt the driver.
    </p>

    <p>
        The driver will have chosen a name for the generalized function, like in part 1,
        but it will need to be changed to <code>find_all</code> for autograding
        reasons. Furthermore, the order of the parameters must be that the
        predicate comes first, then the hand.
