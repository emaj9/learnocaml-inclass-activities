        This is the third exercise in a series that will guide you in writing
        a playable implementation of a game similar to UNO.

        This exercise builds directly on the second part.
        Make sure you complete part 2 first!
    </p>

    <p>
        In this exercise, you will explore purely-functional state management.
        That is, without using mutable variables, how do we encode
        <em>state</em> in functional programming?
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>The big idea</b> is to define a type that represents the state of the
        system, in this case the game of UNO. Functions that "modify" the state
        of the game will actually take as input the current state of the game,
        and output the a new state of the game. Then, by chaining these
        "state-modifying" functions together, we implement the game.
    </p>

    <p>
        This approach to stateful programming has a few advantages over using
        mutable variables. By paying the price of manually passing around the
        state, it becomes easy to implement features such as <em>undo</em>: just
        keep track of the previous state and return to it. (Although, in a
        proper game, taking back a move would be cheating!) We could also
        implement an AI for our game: it can take the current game state, use
        the ordinary gameplay functions we will implement to simulate possible
        moves, evaluate the outcomes of those moves, and choose the best one.
    </p>

    <p>
        The game state type, called <code>game</code>, is already defined for
        you in the prelude. You are encouraged to read the definition and the
        description in the comment below it.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Q1.1. Implement the function</b>
        <code>next_player : game -> game</code> that advances play to the next
        player.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Q1.2. Implement the function</b>
        <code>get_playable_cards : game -> card list</code> that computes a list
        of cards that are allowed to be played by the current player.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Q1.3. Implement the function</b>
        <code>pick_up : game -> game * card</code>
        that removes the top card from the deck and returns it along with the
        updated game state.
        If the deck is empty, then the discard pile is shuffled to first produce
        a new, nonempty deck.
        Take care to preserve the top card of the discard pile when doing this,
        as the discard pile may never be empty in UNO.
        That is, you must shuffle <em>all but the top card</em> of the discard
        pile to produce the new deck.
        Use the function <code>shuffle</code> in the prelude to perform the
        shuffle.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Q1.4. Implement the function</b>
        <code>effect_card : card -> game -> game</code> that performs the effect
        of a card.<br>
        Playing any card has the effect of advancing play to the next player.
        Use the function <code>next_player</code> you wrote earlier to achieve this.
        The special cards <code>Plus2</code>, <code>Skip</code>, and
        <code>Reverse</code> have extra effects.

        <ul>
            <li><b>Skip</b> has the effect of skipping the next player's turn </li>
            <li>
                <b>Reverse</b>
                reverses the order of play, e.g. if the player order is
                <code>A, B, C, D</code> (A is the current player, and suppose this
                order is "clockwise"), then executing a <code>Reverse</code> will
                result in the order <code>A, D, C, B</code>, so that calling
                <code>next_player</code> produces a "counterclockwise" order.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Plus2</b>
                Makes the next player pick up two cards from the deck.
                Use the function <code>pick_up</code> you wrote before to correctly
                handle shuffling the deck in case it should become empty.
                <details>
                    <summary>Hint / style tip.</summary>
                    Advance play to the next player early, then add the two cards
                    picked up to the now-current player's hand.
                </details>
            </li>
        </ul>

        The function <code>effect_card</code> is called at the end of
        <code>play_card</code>, so card selected from the hand of the current
        player has already been removed from their hand and added to the discard
        pile by the time <code>effect_card</code> is called.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this exercise, you modelled the basic flow of a game of UNO: there is
        a way for players to select cards to play, and the effects of cards are
        honored.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the next exercise (TODO) we will explore the player's option to pick
        up a card / their obligation to in case they have no playable cards.
        We will also implement the winning condition of the game, and the setup
        of the initial deck and player hands.
