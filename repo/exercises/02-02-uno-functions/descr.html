        This is the second exercise in a series that will guide you in writing
        a playable implementation of a game similar to UNO.

        This exercise builds directly on the first part. Make sure you complete part 1 first!
    </p>

    <p>
        In this exercise, you will explore the second step of TDD: modelling the
        interactions of the system's components.
        These interactions will take the form of functions. We will pay close
        attention to the notion of <em>invariant</em>, understand what
        invariants are present in the UNO system, and how our functions uphold
        these invariants.
    </p>

    <h2> Interactions between cards </h2>

    <h3> Follow-up cards </h3>

    <p>
        When it's your turn in UNO, here's what usually happens. First try to
        find a <em>suitable</em> card from your hand and play it. If you have no
        suitable cards, then you pick one up from the draw pile. If that card is
        <em>suitable</em>, then you can play it. Otherwise, you simply hold on
        to it and play continues with the next player.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've emphasized the word "suitable" on purpose. This suitability is in
        fact a relation between cards! In particular, you can add a card to the
        discard pile if it meets any of the following conditions.
        <ul>
            <li>
                The value of the top card of the discard pile equals the value
                of the card you want to play; e.g. a <code>3</code> of any color can
                be played on top of a <code>3</code> of any color.
            </li>
            <li>
                The color of the top card of the discard pile equals the color
                of the card you want to play; e.g. any green card can follow any
                other green card.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Q1.1.</b> Let's call this relation between cards the
        <code>can_follow</code> relation. What we need to implement is a
        function that <em>decides</em> this relation. That is, <b>implement the
        function</b> <code>can_follow : card -> card -> bool</code> that outputs
        <code>true</code> if and only if the second card can be played on top of
        the first card.
    </p>

    <details>
        <summary>Follow-up question when you finish Q1.1.</summary>
        Does the order of the cards matter? That is, does <code>can_follow c1 c2
        = can_follow c2 c1</code> for any <code>c1</code>, <code>c2</code>?
        In other words, is the <code>can_follow</code> relation <em>symmetric?</em>
    </details>

    <h3> Finding all follow-ups </h3>

    <p>
        Let's imagine how one would play our game for a moment.
        When it's a player's turn, they will choose a card from their hand to
        play or choose to pick up a card from the draw pile.
    </p>

    <p>
        One way to achieve this is to prompt the player with a list of choices,
        one for each card from their hand that they could play, and a final
        choice along the lines of "pick up a card".
        To create this list of choices, we need to identify all the possible
        follow-up cards from the player's hand.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Q1.2. Implement the function</b>
        <code>all_follow_ups : card -> hand -> hand</code>
        that identifies from the given hand all the possible follow-ups to the
        given card.
    </p>

    <h3> Hand management </h3>

    <p>
        <b>Q1.3.</b> Next, we will need to add and remove cards from decks and
        hands and discard piles. Fortunately, these are all the same thing,
        (lists of cards,) so we only need one implementation for adding, and one
        for removing.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Q1.3.1. Implement the function</b>
        <code>add_card : card -> hand -> hand</code> that adds a card to the
        given hand.

        <details>
            <summary>Hint: don't overthink it...</summary>
            A hand is simply a list of cards; how do we add an element to a list?
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Reveal this after completing the implementation.</summary>
            You might wonder why we bothered defining <code>add_card</code> at
            all since it would be much shorter to simply write <code>a ::
            b</code> instead of <code>add_card a b</code>.
            The purpose is to make our code both more domain-specific and more
            abstract: if we directly used <code>::</code>, then we would expose
            the fact that hands, decks, and discard piles are all lists of
            cards.
            By defining <code>add_card</code>, we make it easier to change the
            representation of these concepts if we should need to later in a
            refactoring.
        </details>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Q1.3.2. Implement the function</b>
        <code>remove_card : card -> hand -> hand</code> that removes
        <em>one</em> instance of the given card from the given hand.
        This will take more code than implementing <code>add_hand</code>!
        <br>
        UNO cards, unlike standard playing cards, are not all unique: there are
        several green threes for example. Ensure to only remove one and not
        all instances of the given card.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this exercise, you modelled the fundamental relation between UNO
        cards, the <code>can_follow</code> relation. You built on this relation
        by extending it to hands in a natural way, by filtering the hand
        according whether its consituent cards can follow a fixed, given card.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the next exercise, you will explore the notion of <em>game
        state</em>. That is, you will see how we can represent the state of the
        game and how to encode changes to this state, all without using mutable
        variables.
