	<h1> UNO Part 1 </h1>
	<p>
		This is the first exercise in a series of exercises that will help you write a working version of UNO in
		LearnOCaml!

		The purpose of these exercises is to firstly have a little fun, and hopefully at the same time introduce you to
		some tenents behind "type driven development"
	</p>
	<h2> Type Driven Development </h2>
	<p>

		Type driven development is a style of programming in which we write types first and use those types to guide
		the rest of our development.

		When you write a program, you often have a conceptual model in your head of how the program should work,
		how the compoennts interact, and how the data is organized. At first this idea will be very vague but as we
		get to coding, we start articulating that vision.

		The first step of type drive dev is identifying the types of the program. The types are like the basic
		components
		or parts of our game.

		To start you probably have a few ideas about the components of Uno.
		For instance, we have hands of cards, players, kinds of cards (e.x. skip turn, pick up two), draw deck, discard,
		etc.

		Let's start typing!

	</p>
	<h2> Cards and Hands </h2>

	<h3>Card colors</h3>
	<p>
		Let's begin with cards.
		Recall the deck of UNO cards:
		<i>insert uno card images here</i>
		what information is on the card? What are all the possible kinds of cards (e.g. color, or value like a number or
		action?
		Fill in the type definition for <code>color</code> on the left. For now we are going to ignore black cards
	</p>
	<h3>Card values</h3>
	<p>
		Now we can repeat this process with values. This one is a little more tricky.
	</p>
	<h3> Making cards</h3>
	Now we can define cards!
	<h2>Type Alisaes</h2>
	Sometimes it's convenient to create type aliases.
	The only thing we need to know about a player is their hand,
	but it's nicer to refer to them as a 'player' than just as a 'hand'
	even though for us those are really the same thing.
	<p> Hands are just list of cards so we can write that! </p>
	Write out player deck discardd

	<h2> Helper functions </h2>
	Now let's get a bit more familiar and start coding some functions that will serve us.

	An important concept in UNO is if a card can follow another: <i> insert rules</i>
